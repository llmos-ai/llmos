[LLMOS](https://llmos.1block.ai/) is an open-source, cloud-native infrastructure software tailored for managing AI applications and Large Language Models(LLMs).

## Key Features
- **Easy Installation:** Seamlessly install on x86_64 or ARM64 architectures for an out-of-the-box user experience.
- **Comprehensive LLM Lifecycle Management:** A unified interface for both developers and non-developers to manage LLM infrastructure, ML Clusters, models and workloads.
- **Easy to Use:** Build models and AI applications in your own way, without the need to managing Kubernetes & infrastructure directly.
- **Optimized for Edge & Branch Deployment:** Enhance resource efficiency and simplify model deployment in edge and branch networks, while maintaining the capability to scale horizontally for larger workloads.


## Quick Start

Make sure your nodes meet the [requirements](https://llmos.1block.ai/docs/installation/requirements) before proceeding.

### Installation Script

LLMOS can be installed to a bare-metal server or a virtual machine. To bootstrap a **new cluster**, follow the steps below:

```shell
curl -sfL https://get-llmos.1block.ai | sh -s - --cluster-init --token mytoken
```

To monitor installation logs, run `journalctl -u llmos -f`.

After installation, you may optionally add a worker node to the cluster with the following command:
```shell
curl -sfL https://get-llmos.1block.ai | LLMOS_SERVER=https://server-url:6443 LLMOS_TOKEN=mytoken sh -s -
```

### Config Proxy
If your environment requires internet access through a proxy, set the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables before running the installation script:

```shell
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
export NO_PROXY=127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16 # Replace the CIDRs with your own
```

## Getting Started

After installing LLMOS, access the dashboard by navigating to `https://<server-ip>:8443` in your web browser.

1. LLMOS will create a default `admin` user with a randomly generated password. To retrieve the password, run the following command on the **cluster-init** node:
    ```shell
    kubectl get secret --namespace llmos-system llmos-bootstrap-passwd -o go-template='{{.data.password|base64decode}}{{"\n"}}'
    ```

1. Upon logging in, you will be redirected to the setup page. Configure the following:
    - Set a **new password** for the admin user (strong passwords are recommended).
    - Configure the **server URL** that all other nodes in your cluster will use to connect.
